<h1>Basics of AI</h1>
<p>
AI, or artificial intelligence, is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.
AI research has been highly successful in developing effective techniques for solving a wide range of problems, from game playing to medical diagnosis.
</p>
<h2>Machine Learning</h2>
<p>
Machine learning is a type of AI that allows software applications to become more accurate in predicting outcomes without being explicitly programmed to do so.
Machine learning algorithms use historical data as input to predict new output values.
</p>
<h2>Neural Networks</h2>
<p>
Neural networks are a type of machine learning algorithm that is inspired by the human brain.
Neural networks are able to learn from data and improve their performance over time.
</p>
<h2>Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning</h2>
<p>
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is trained on a dataset that has been labeled.
The algorithm learns to map input data to output data.
Unsupervised learning is a type of machine learning in which the algorithm is trained on a dataset that has not been labeled.
The algorithm learns to find patterns in the data.
