<h1>Generative AI</h1>
<p>
Generative AI is a type of AI that can create new data that is similar to existing data.
Generative AI techniques can be used to generate realistic images, text, and music.
</p>
<h2>GANs</h2>
<p>
GANs, or generative adversarial networks, are a type of generative AI that uses two neural networks to generate new data.
One neural network, the generator, creates new data, while the other neural network, the discriminator, tries to distinguish between the new data and real data.
</p>
<h2>VAEs</h2>
<p>
VAEs, or variational autoencoders, are a type of generative AI that uses a neural network to learn a distribution of data.
The neural network can then be used to generate new data from the distribution.
